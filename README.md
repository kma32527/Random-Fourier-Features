# Random-Fourier-Features
A test of Algorithm 1 [Random Fourier Features] from 'Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines'(2015) on the adult dataset using the code supplied with the paper. This algorithm generates features from a dataset by randomly sampling from a basis of harmonic functions in Fourier space.
