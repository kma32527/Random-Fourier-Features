# Random-Fourier-Features
A test implementation of Algorithm 1 [Random Fourier Features] from 'Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines'(2015) on the adult dataset. This algorithm uses randomly selected harmonic functions to sample from a translation-invariant kernel.

# Side Note

- The usage of a translation invariant kernel with normalized data is equivalent to "without loss of generality suppose U is the complex unit disk"
