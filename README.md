# Random-Fourier-Features
An implementation of Algorithm 1 [Random Fourier Features] from 'Random Features for Large-Scale Kernel Machines'(2015) on the adult dataset. This algorithm uses a basis of harmonic functions with randomly generated frequencies to provide a low-dimensional approximation a translation-invariant kernel.

# Side Note

- The usage of a translation invariant kernel with normalized data is equivalent to "without loss of generality suppose U is the complex unit disk"
